</a>

The Wi-Fi Stock Crossover Notifier is an Arduino-based project that monitors stock data in real-time and sends email notifications when specific moving average crossovers occur. The project focuses on short-term investing using the 9 & 21 EMA crossover and long-term investing using the 50 & 200 SMA crossover strategies.

## Introduction

Traders/Investors often utilize moving average crossovers as a technical analysis tool to identify potential trend reversals or shifts in market sentiment. The Wi-Fi Stock Crossover Notifier automates this process by combining the power of Arduino microcontrollers, Wi-Fi connectivity module, and algorithmic trading strategies.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The system continuously fetches up-to-date stock data through a chosen stock data API.
- **Crossover Detection:** Utilizes algorithms to detect crossovers based on Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).
- **Email Notifications:** Sends email notifications to a specified address when a crossover is identified, allowing users to stay informed about potential trading opportunities.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- ESP8266 or ESP32 Wi-Fi module for Internet connectivity

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Programming Language (C++, Embedded C, Python)
- Necessary libraries (e.g., ESP8266WiFi, SMTPClient)
- RESTAPI/FastAPI, HTTP Requests
- Stock data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage)
- Email service (e.g., SMTPClient for Email communication)
- Stock data API key
- Email account for notifications

<!---
## Setup

1. Connect the Arduino to your computer.
2. Install the required Arduino libraries and set up the Arduino IDE.
3. Configure the Wi-Fi module to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
4. Obtain a stock data API key and configure the code to fetch real-time stock data.
5. Set up an email account for sending notifications and configure the email settings in the code.

## Usage

1. Upload the Arduino sketch to the microcontroller.
2. Power on the Arduino and Wi-Fi module.
3. The system will start monitoring stock data and generate email notifications on crossovers.

## Configuration

- Adjust the stock symbols, moving average periods, and other parameters in the code.
- Ensure secure storage of sensitive information such as API keys and email credentials.

## BackTesting

- Test the system with historical data to validate crossover detection.
- Simulate trading scenarios to ensure proper functionality.

## Security Considerations

- Securely store API keys and email credentials.
- Regularly monitor and update the project for security patches.
